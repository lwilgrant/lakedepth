GlobalLakeStatus.dat - an additional file for GlobalLakeDepth.dat. It provides the 
gridded data of the status of the information about lake depth, gridded value.

Value of status characterizes the reliability of data in GlobalLakeDepth.dat:
= 0 - no lake or river is indicated in this pixel in land cover dataset ECOCLIMAP2 
      (sea or land), mean lake depth = 0 meters;
= 1 - no any of information about this lake in the list of individual lakes, no 
      bathemetry data, set the default lake depth value of 10 meters;
= 2 - no measured mean depth information about this lake in the list of individual 
      lakes, no bathemetry data, set the default lake depth value of 10 meters;  
= 3 - information about lake depth in this pixel is from the list of individual or 
      bathemetry data - measured depth value;
= 4 - this is the river pixel according to ECOCLIMAP2, set the default lake depth 
      value of 3 meters;
= 5 - lake depth in this pixel is estimated by an expert evaluation method;
= 6 - lake depth in this pixel is estimated by the geographical method;
= 7 - lake depth in this pixel is estimated by the geomorphologic method.

-- list of 36 lakes with bathemetry data - please see LrgeLakesIncluded.txt file; 
-- list of individual lakes,
-- different methods used to estimate most probable mean lake depths - please see

   of GLDBv2, or "frequently asked questions" published on the FLake webpage.


An example of opening the binary file in FORTRAN90:
-- open(2, file = 'GlobalLakeStatus.dat', form='unformatted', access='direct', recl=1)

An example of reading the binary file in FORTRAN90:
-- read(2,rec=n) LakeStatus
-- where: n - record number, INTEGER(8);
          LakeStatus - coded information for the reliability of of lake data in 
          GlobalLakeDepth.dat, INTEGER(1).
          

Information about the binary file:
-- byte order - little endian;
-- form - simple binary;
-- resolution - 30 arc. sec;
-- coordinate system: geography;
-- dimension of the array - 43200 X 21600 (longitude X latitude);
-- longitude (-180,+180), latitude (+90,-90);
-- start of the records - Northern Pole (+90 latitude), -180 longitude.

Information about the pixel:
-- values are written as INTEGER(1);
-- pixel size - (1/120) X (1/120), in degrees of longitude and latitude;
-- pixel coordinates are given for the lower right corner.
